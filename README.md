# Statistics Project 2

## Overview
This repository contains a statistics project that covers tasks such as sampling from distributions, visualizing multi-dimensional data, creating QQ plots, computing convolutions of distributions, and implementing and comparing sampling means.

## Skills Used
- Sampling from Distributions
- Multi-dimensional Data Visualization
- QQ Plots
- Convolution of Distributions
- Sampling Means

## Contents
1. **Sampling and Visualization:**
   - Generate and visualize 4-D data using normal and uniform distributions.

2. **QQ Plot:**
   - Create a QQ plot for standard normal and standard Cauchy distributions.

3. **Convolution of Distributions:**
   - Compute the convolution of Beta(2,8) and Beta(8,2) distributions.

4. **Sampling Means:**
   - Implement functions to compute sample means and visualize histograms.
   - Define a class for sample mean distributions and plot their PDFs.

## Usage
To run the analyses and visualizations, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can execute the provided code snippets in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.

## File
- `statistics-project-2.pdf`: Contains all the code and analyses used in this project.
